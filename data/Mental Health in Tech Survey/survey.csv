Every employer must pay 3.6% of every employee's salary to the insurance fund like a tax. Everyone gets free healthcare at public clinics and hospitals. Some types of healthcare including mental health are still funded from the government budget but that doesn't matter it's still FREE!However this is Russia :D I don't know much about what actually happens in mental hospitals here except that a lot of young people with male in their passports use these to avoid military draft and doctors seem to help them.

At best though she was bipolar and at worst - who knowsI have bipolar disorder. I have zero faith that an organization with policies in place could appropriately handle mental health. I have even less faith that a workplace without the policies in place could appropriately handle mental health. I can only imagine it's worse in full tech environments.

Currently dealing with depression and anxiety as well as drug addition.Employer provides & pays premiums on insurance which covers therapy and prescriptions.  Employer allows work-from-home and unlimited PTO which makes episodes easier to control.I don't speak of my problems to anyone at work except for the people that I consider friends and even then I don't go into great detail.I would never bring up a mental health issue during an interview for fear of discrimination and rejection (and therefore greater depression).  One co-worker had serious anxiety problems and would not inform his team of episodes and was eventually let go for being unresponsive.

You are depressed: take vacation. You feel weird: admit it is physical (otherwise it is not serious) go and see a doctor (and if you are on sick leave too many days you will get fired). You don't feel good today: take a holiday but don't work from home. In startup there is what I call the tyranny of happiness: you have to look happy to be accepted and to be worked with. At some point playing a role can definitely make the mental health issue worse and it is also a threat to diversity :(I don't like to call mental health issues an issue but actually when it comes to company field it too often becomes an issue and this is sad because working is sometimes better than medication. It is a vicious circle: people are scared of speaking about it so they don't inform their coworkers about what mental health is for real and so coworkers are so scared on a regular basis that the people with mental health issues keep it for themselves.

There's very much a stigma.

For some people telling your current supervisor that you have a history of bi-polar disorder might be easier than telling a potential employer that you have a history of compulsive gambling. They might both be bits of irrelevant information (past behavior and not indicators of future behavior). However western culture pushes us to appear as capable as possible to our supervisors in pursuit of excellence in our work. Providing information that could create a negative bias seems like a more genuine and yet more risky approach to the discussion.

Physical health care is very much accepted with a doctor that certifies your ailment.  Mental health is treated quite differently I believe because most people are willing to admit that physical ailments should be covered while mental ailments are almost considered non-existent in most respects.

Thanks for doing this.

I was standing up in the back of the room so that i could pace and try to prevent myself from falling asleep. I still managed to fall asleep while standing and fell over against the wall. I was fired the next day. The worst part is this is a condition i had given months of notice about to my boss and i reminded her of it before the meeting. I worked at a hospital at the time. I would have thought that they would be more accommodating.

Because of that my employer - or any future employer - kind of knows by default. It's not a secret. That said the downside of that openness is that I have no faith that I wouldn't be discriminated against at a future job simply because the information is public. Likewise I worry I'm seen as less-than by my employer in some circumstances. Regerdless I don't regret being public and raising awareness. My point is that even those of us who do publicly discuss the issue fear systemic retribution.

Now that we've grown things are better but I feel that overall our total benefits package (including healthcare) isn't well communicated. This reflects negatively on the mental health questions above but would also reflect negatively on any other sort of survey about the benefits. That is I don't think the company is purposefully doing less for mental health. They just aren't doing enough across the board and that includes mental health.

I felt I could trust my direct supervisor so I divulged information. It ended up spreading to more supervisors and eventually my coworkers. Supers highly suggested treatment but rushed things that shouldn't have been rushed and I ended up being incorrectly treated in a psych ward and mentally scarred from the issue. I lost most of my desire to program due to the experience not to mention thousands of dollars I lost - lost work time vacation time they used for treatment time doctors expenses etc. I have major depressive disorder high anxiety and mild agoraphobia. After seeing what treatment has to offer I will likely not seek it again and continue as is. (Long story short.)

I think the team at large tried their best to be kind but that's how the person suffered.  The company actually gave this person a lot of help.  Which was cool.  But the team still discriminated.

Over here people don't need benefits from their employer because we pay enough taxes for the government to pay for treatment of any physical or mental condition. We don't need employer approval for medical leave; that's something a qualified medical professional decides (and while on leave we still get paid our salaries something the employer can get insurance for). I answered yes to questions about these things meaning it's covered not it's covered by my employer.

This usage of a different schedule for UCR and often the lower rate is very hard to determine before purchasing insurance even in the new health insurance exchanges.

Growing up in a family open about mental health and also at the end of my rope I immediately shared with management what was going on. I requested a temporary reduced workload so I could reduce anxiety. (At time I didn't know it was anxiety as took me a year to accept that the (to me) deserved stress was anxiety caused by my core diagnosis.) When disclosing I didn't deeply understand details of the state of my mental health; I simply knew I was so stressed out by having been unable to get myself to do work in three months that I couldn't juggle all that was currently on my plate.It was at this point my direct manager and I began an almost daily struggle. After working on a single project and making progress (compared to 3 months before diagnosis when management didn't even know how bad I was doing) I requested increasing my workload. This was never granted; boss said I hadn't proved myself and implied I could not be trusted.Two huge issues stick out to me from that experience:1) Company assumes things would be better and back to 100% within months. They did not understand what one goes through when figuring out meds: things at times got worse. They did not understand how long it takes until meds are figured out: mine took two years. They most certainly would not truly understand why to this day four years later despite being stable I'm in counseling every other week in addition to being on meds. Rather than supporting that it would be seen as oh I'm sorry. I was a problem to my manager because he didn't see improvements each week.2) Accomodations.- There was no option for me to reduce work temporarily to part-time (too complicated). Instead they pushed me to take disability leave. I told them that wouldn't help; they told me to double-check with care providers. That required me to see a psychologist unnecessarily as psychologist said I didn't qualify for leave. (Expensive unnecessary appointment).- The assistance I needed the most at work was understanding: I was open but my manager told me to not tell my co-worker assigned to support me. That was disasterous for colleague's stress/frustration levels. He knew something was up but was barred from asking and I was implied it was better to keep my mouth shut.- Accommodations weren't understood by even Benefits as they're not trained in mental health nor do they have people come in to assess how they're doing in supporting those with mental health issues. Should be no different than people coming in to assess for physical accessibility of the workplace. When in a meeting with my manager supervised by HR I shouldn't feel like I'm asking too much of manager when requesting he put the negative critiques on the back burner and help me figure out whether I'm doing anything right. That this didn't stop him from coming into my office that same day and putting on my dick hat to yell at me for something that wasn't even my fault (he had brought in co-worker for this yelling and turned to finish yelling at this person): FUCKING UNACCEPTABLE.While I will never return to that company and as such took the severance package I will NEVER agree with their legal reason for being unable to do the job: me being medically disqualified from this role. I was too expensive in the short term for them; I'm not worth the cost.

On the other hand if a female in tech does not commiserate with her male coworkers on mental health problems she will no longer be seen as a team player. It is really a catch-22 for women in STEM.

For the past years I've really been working hard to get myself (known) in the community. The people in the community that know can be counted on one hand. In general I'm not telling anyway unless it really matters and it would be a gain in some way or the other. Not because I don't trust the community members close to me but because I don't want to be that guy. And IMHO it doesn't and shouldn't matter but sadly some people are funky about that. Yet sometimes I wan't to tell everyone what I've been through and share my lessons learned.

I worked too much had too much pressure on myself from being the sole developer on a delayed project that seemed to grow in size with each week it was delayed by and worried about money a lot.I became depressed and anxious and had trouble eating sleeping and generally being myself. As my depression worsened I was regularly late for work couldn't perform as well as I should and became irritable with my colleagues.My employers response after a while was to send me private messages complaining about my lateness which only worsened the situation. I was prescribed 3 weeks off work by my doctor which my employer agreed to only to come back after to find I had been on 'statutory pay' which was roughly half of what I was expecting and was not enough to cover my rent bills AND food. This made me worse and sent me into another depression until I eventually admitted defeat gave up working and left the company. It took me months to recover and I'm now left (over 6 months after this all started) recovering from the fallout I created leaving employment with hardly any money to my name.I had previously been told by my employer that I was too young to burn out and (stupidly) trusted them. I did not feel comfortable discussing my problems with my employer because each time I was met with an attitude that I had to get myself together and ultimately given the amount of employees before me who had left the company by being fired after an altercation with the employer left me with no option but to hide it from them so I too wouldn't be fired.

Most (all?) of the Prompt-sponsored/related presentations I've seen have been about congenital mental health issues that are treatable with continued medication. For me medication only provided temporary assistance. I needed years of (continuing) therapy to deal with PTSD and related disorders (depression anxiety suicidal tendencies others). I haven't seen many in our community discussing trauma-related mental health issues but they are just as real and just as debilitating.
